# Hi there 👋
Welcome to the ***Federico Giovenco*** repositories as you can see my nickname on GitHub differs from my name as it does on all social networks because the name with which I identify myself on the Internet is **SayMeCoco** 👨‍💻.

In this fantastic place you will be able to find all the projects that I have been carrying out throughout my short life 💻.
